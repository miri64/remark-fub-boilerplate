# Remark boilerplate for Freie Universität Berlin

This provide a boilerplate for Freie Universität Berlin slide sets for the
Remark slideshow tool. It is based on [Remark v0.14.0].

## Usage
For the most part the Remark markdown syntax applies. To get a title slide use
either

```yaml
name: title-slide-cover
```

for a title slide with a cover image or

```yaml
name: title-slide
```

for a title slide without a cover image.

To modify the cover image, replace the `figs/cover.png` with a 250x250 PNG.
